# Smart-Helmet


The project involves the development of a prototype smart helmet equipped with advanced features aimed at significantly enhancing rider safety. The proposed helmet integrates sensors and a 3-axis accelerometer to detect accidents and hazardous conditions. Through the fusion of sensor data and sophisticated algorithms, the system can accurately identify abnormal events indicative of accidents. In the event of a detected accident, the helmet automatically triggers SOS notifications as alert calls and messages with Google Map location link to predefined contacts. This project with a more comprehensive approach can be implemented to reduce fatalities and injuries on roads.
